# flexutils
Some utilities I wrote for working with files from the FLEX operating system for 6809, while adapting it for my own board. Currently contains:
* flex2sr  - Converts from a FLEX binary to Motorola S-records
* sr2flex  - Converts from Motorola S-records to a FLEX binary
* mkflexfs - Creates an empty FLEX disk image
